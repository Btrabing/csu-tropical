<h3>CSU Tropical Cyclone Impact Probabilities</h3>
<p>We are debuting a new methodology for calculating the impacts of tropical cyclones for each state and county/parish along the Gulf and East Coasts, tropical cyclone-prone provinces of Canada, islands in the Caribbean and countries in Central America. We have used NOAA’s <a href = "https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes"> Historical Hurricane Tracks website </a> and selected all named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes that have tracked within 50 miles of each landmass from 1880-2020.  This approach allows for tropical cyclones that may have tracked through an immediately adjacent region to be counted for all regions that were in close proximity to the location of the storm. We then fit the observed frequency of storms within 50 miles of each landmass using a Poisson distribution to calculate the climatological odds of one or more events within 50 miles.
Net landfall probability is shown to be linked to the overall Atlantic basin Net Tropical Cyclone activity (NTC).  NTC is a combined measure of the year-to-year mean of six indices of hurricane activity, each expressed as a percentage difference from the 1950-2000 climatological average.  Long-term statistics show that, on average, the more active the overall Atlantic basin hurricane season is, the greater the probability of U.S. hurricane landfall.
Use the drop-down to obtain the climatological odds of storms tracking within 50 miles of each state along the Gulf and East Coasts along with the odds for the remainder of the 2021 season based on our current forecast for a NTC of 154 after 8 July.
All of the calculations are also available in a downloadable spreadsheet.

<h3>CSU Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) index</h3>
<p>In 2008, Phil Klotzbach and Bill Gray published <a href="/Forecast/AMO_paper.pdf" target="_blank">a paper in Journal of Climate</a> discussing a newly-developed Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation index that utilized a combination of two predictors: 1) Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the far North Atlantic from 50-60°N, 50-10°W and 2) sea level pressures (SLPs) in the North Atlantic from 0-50°N, 70-10°W. At present, the index is calculated by weighing the SST component as 60% of the index and the SLP component as the remaining 40%. All values are standardized using the 1981-2010 climatological average as a baseline. Real-time monthly values are calculated from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis and are typically updated by the 5th of the following month.</p>
