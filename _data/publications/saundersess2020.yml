  keypoint1: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season witnessed activity 25% above
    the long-term average, due mainly to high activity in the subtropics
  keypoint2: The environmental fields that explain most variance in long-term hurricane
    activity all predicted a below-normal 2018 hurricane season
  keypoint3: The 2018 hurricane season highlights the need for seasonal hurricane
    outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance
  abstract: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive season with
    hurricanes Florence and Michael causing significant damage in the southeastern
    United States. In keeping with most destructive hurricane seasons, basinwide tropical
    cyclone activity was above average in 2018?by ~25% for named storm numbers, hurricane
    numbers, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). In contrast to this above-normal
    activity, the August?September tropical environmental fields that explain ~50%
    of the variance in Atlantic basin hurricane activity between 1950 and 2017 anticipated
    a well below-average 2018 hurricane season. The surprisingly large mismatch between
    the observed and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme
    example of the uncertainty inherent in seasonal hurricane outlooks and highlights
    the need for these outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance.
    Such probabilistic information would better clarify the uncertainty associated
    with hurricane outlooks to the benefit of users. With retrospective knowledge
    of the August?September 2018 key tropical environmental fields, the chance that
    the observed 2018 Atlantic hurricane activity would occur is about 5%. The reasons
    for the surprisingly high hurricane activity in 2018 are a hurricane outbreak
    in early September and, in particular, the occurrence of unusually high tropical
    cyclone activity in the subtropical North Atlantic. The hyperactive subtropical
    activity was not anticipated because contemporary statistical models of seasonal
    Atlantic hurricane activity lack skill in anticipating subtropical ACE compared
    to tropical ACE.
  summary: Seasonal outlooks for North Atlantic hurricane activity contribute to the
    anticipation of risk for insurance companies, other weather-sensitive businesses,
    and local and national governments. However, the uncertainty associated with such
    forecasts is often unclear. This reduces their benefit and contributes to the
    perception of forecast “busts.” The issue is highlighted by the destructive and
    surprising 25% above-average 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Retrospective examination
    of the key August–September 2018 environmental fields that explain ~50% of long‐term
    Atlantic hurricane activity shows that all were consistent with a well below‐average
    2018 hurricane season. A below‐normal season was also anticipated by hurricane
    outlooks issued in early August 2018. The large mismatch between the observed
    and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme example of the
    uncertainty inherent in hurricane outlooks. We show that this uncertainty may
    be properly clarified by expressing outlooks in terms of probability of exceedance.
    The likelihood that the observed 2018 hurricane activity would occur with retrospective
    knowledge of the key environmental fields is about 5%. Hyperactive storm activity
    in the subtropical North Atlantic contributed to the surprisingly active 2018
    hurricane season. The unusual subtropical activity was not anticipated because
    statistical models lack skill in anticipating such activity.

  caption: FIG. 3. Scatter plots showing the nature and the strength of the links
    between three key environmental fields in Table 1 and ACE (×104 kt2). These links
    are displayed for 1950–2017 data (left column) and for 1979–2017 data (right column).
    The environmental fields are (a and b) August–September 925 hPa uT, (c and d)
    August–September MDR SST, and (e and f) August–September 200–850 hPa zonal VWS.
    Each panel shows the best fit linear regression line (computed by transforming
    ACE and each environmental field to normal distributions and then transforming
    back) and the percentage of the ACE variance that this line explains (r2). Red
    circles denote the 2018 values. Green circles denote the 2013 values (mentioned
    in section 6.1).
