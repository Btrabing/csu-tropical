  keypoint1: Boreal summer western North Pacific tropical cyclone frequency is inversely
    linked to the concurrent Pacific-North American pattern
  keypoint2: A greater number of tropical cyclones form north (south) of 12.5°N during
    low (high) Pacific-North American pattern phases
  keypoint3: The Pacific-North American pattern influences tropical cyclone genesis
    predominately by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions
  abstract: The frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific
    during June–November has a significant inverse correlation with the concurrent
    Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern from 1965 to 2016. During low PNA years,
    more TCs form north of 12.5°N, with significantly greater  TC occurrences from
    15 to 20°N, compared to high PNA years. The difference in TC genesis location
    can be explained by the differences in the genesis potential index derived from
    the environmental variables in both PNA phases. The PNA influences TC formation
    primarily by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions, with thermodynamic conditions
    playing a lesser role. In low PNA years, low-level anomalous cyclonic lows over
    the Philippines and in the subtropical central Pacific provide significant positive
    relative vorticity anomalies favorable for TC genesis. Additionally, there is
    also less vertical wind shear to the north of the Philippines due to enhanced
    winds at low levels and weaker winds at upper levels.
  summary: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are the most devastating natural disasters in many
    coastal regions, including over the western North Pacific (WNP). Therefore, the
    characteristics and driving mechanisms of WNP TC activity have been studied extensively
    over the past several decades. Previous publications indicated that El Niño-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) played the most important role on an interannual basis in modulating
    WNP TC formation, movement, and intensity. However, the interannual frequency
    of WNP TCs is only weakly influenced by ENSO. Here we find that there exists a
    significant negative correlation between the annual number of boreal summer WNP
    TCs and the concurrent Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. Distinct from other
    climate modes (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation),
    the inverse relationship between WNP TC frequency and the PNA is relatively stable
    and independent of the period analyzed. Furthermore, the PNA influences the formation
    of WNP TCs through a modulation of the large-scale environment, particularly the
    dynamic conditions. During low PNA years, the large-scale dynamic conditions are
    more favorable for TC development, compared to high PNA years. Our results imply
    that one may be able to improve the prediction of WNP TC frequency by considering
    variations in the PNA pattern.
