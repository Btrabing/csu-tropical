  keypoint1: This manuscript proposes using the QBO to model cyclone tracks over the
    North Indian Ocean
  keypoint2: More North Indian Ocean TCs were found to form when the QBO was in its
    east phase than when the QBO was in its west phase, and these TCs were more likely
    to track westward and northwestward.
  keypoint3: Alternatively, when the QBO was in its west phase, TCs were more likely
    to track northward and northeastward.
  abstract: Previous studies have shown that the skill of seasonal forecasts of tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) tends to be poor. This
    paper investigates the forecast potential of TC formation, trajectories and points
    of landfall in the NIO region using an index of the stratospheric quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) as the predictor variable in a new statistical seasonal forecast
    model. Genesis was modelled by kernel density estimation, tracks were fitted using
    a generalized additive model (GAM) approach with an Euler integration step, and
    landfall location was estimated using a country mask. The model was trained on
    30 years of TC observations (1980–2009) from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
    and the QBO index at lags from 0 to 6 months. Over this time period, and within
    each season and QBO phase, the kernel density estimator modelled the distribution
    of genesis points, and the cyclone trajectories were then fit by the GAM along
    the observed cyclone tracks as smooth functions of location. Trajectories were
    simulated from randomly selected genesis points in the kernel density estimates.
    Ensembles of cyclone paths were traced, taking account of random innovations every
    6-hr along the GAM-fitted velocity fields, to determine the points of landfall.
    Lead–lag analysis was used to assess the best predictor timescales for TC forecast
    potential. We found that the best model utilized the QBO index with a 3-month
    lead. Two hindcast validation methods were applied. First, leave-one-out cross-validation
    was performed where the country of landfall was decided by the majority vote of
    the simulated tracks. Second, the distances between the landfall locations in
    the observations and simulations were calculated. Application of seasonal forecast
    analysis further indicated that including information on the state of the QBO
    has the potential to improve the skill of TC seasonal forecasts in the NIO region.
