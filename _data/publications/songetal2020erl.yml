  abstract: Rapid intensification (RI) refers to a significant increase in tropical
    cyclone (TC) intensity over a short period of time. A TC can also undergo multiple
    RI events during its lifetime, and these RI events pose a significant challenge
    for operational forecasting. The long-term tendency in RI magnitude of TCs over
    the western North Pacific is investigated in this study. During 1979-2018, a significant
    increasing trend is found in RI magnitude, which primarily results from the significant
    increasing number of strong RI events, defined as 24-h intensity increases of
    at least 50 kt. Furthermore, there are significantly more (slightly fewer) strong
    RI occurrences west (east) of 155°E in 1999-2018 than in 1979-1998. Significant
    increases in strong RI occurrences are located over the region bounded by 10°~20°N,
    120°~150°E. These changes are likely induced by the warming ocean but appear uncorrelated
    with changes in the atmospheric environment. By contrast, there are slight decreases
    in strong RI occurrences over the region bounded by 12.5°~22.5°N, 155°~170°E,
    likely due to the offset between RI-favorable influences of the warming ocean
    and RI-unfavorable influences of increasing vertical wind shear (VWS).

  caption: "Fig. 2. (a) Slope of the quantiles for 24-h intensity changes (ΔV24s)
    for all TCs over the WNP from 1979-2018. Circles represent the slope derived by
    the least squares of ΔV24 as a function of year for each quantile from 5% to 95%
    in 5% intervals. Filled circles indicate that the slope is significant at the
    0.05 level. Shading denotes the standard error of the estimated slope, representing
    the average distance that the original values fall from the regression line. (b)
    Annual averages for RI magnitude of WNP TCs from 1979 to 2018. The dashed line
    shows the long-term linear trend obtained by least squares. (c) Annual numbers
    of 24-h WNP RI events in weak-moderate (< 50 kt) and strong RI (≥50 kt) categories
    during 1979-2018. Gray and black lines denote the numbers of weak-moderate RI
    events and strong RI events, respectively. Dashed lines indicate linear trends
    derived from least squares.   \n"
