  abstract: Here we discuss recent progress in understanding tropical cyclone (TC)
    subseasonal variability and its prediction. There has been a concerted effort
    to understand the sources of predictability at subseasonal time-scales, and this
    effort has continued to make progress in recent years. Besides the Madden-Julian
    Oscillation (MJO), other modes of variability affect TCs at these time-scales,
    in particular various equatorial waves. Additionally, TC activity is also modulated
    by extratropical processes via Rossby wave breaking. There has also been progress
    in the ability of models to simulate the MJO and its modulation of TC activity.
    Community efforts have created multi-model ensemble datasets, which have made
    it possible to evaluate the forecast skill of the MJO and TCs on subseasonal time-scales
    in multiple forecasting systems. While there is positive skill in some cases,
    there is strong dependence on the ensemble system considered, the basin examined,
    and whether the storms have extratropical influences or not. Furthermore, the
    definition of skill differs among studies. Forecasting centers are currently issuing
    subseasonal TC forecasts using various techniques (statistical, statistical-dynamical
    and dynamical). There is also a strong interest in the private sector for forecasts
    with 3-4 weeks lead time.

    Fig. 3. Plots of the MJOâ€“TC relationship in the observations and from the S2S
    models from week 2 forecasts. The color of each circle indicates the PDF (%) in
    the corresponding MJO phase in the basin. The sum of the circles across the MJO
    phases in each basin is 100%. The black circle outline indicates that the value
    is above the 90th percentile while the cross symbol (x) at the center means the
    value is below the 10th percentile. The percentage on the title corresponds to
    the spatial correlation of that model plot with observations (top panel). Figure
