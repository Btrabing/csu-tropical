  keypoint1: Relationship between ENSO and Western North Pacific tropical cyclone
    season onset changed in the late 1990s
  keypoint2: Strong El Nino events have been associated with late starting Western
    North Pacific tropical cyclone seasons throughout the satellite era
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: Most studies have focused on variations of tropical cyclone (TC) frequency,
    intensity, and track over the western North Pacific (WNP), but variability of
    WNP TC season onset date (TCSO) has been less studied. Recent research has indicated
    a close association between WNP TCSO and sea surface temperature (SST) over the
    tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical central-eastern Pacific. This study has
    found that relationship between TCSO and SST underwent an inter-decadal change
    in the late 1990s, likely due to a climate shift that occurred around that time.
    An observed significant correlation between TCSO and SST before the late 1990s
    has been insignificant since that time. This was confirmed by the fact that El
    Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at 0.46 positively correlates with TCSO from
    1965 – 1999 (significant at the 95 % level), and the correlation becomes insignificant
    (0.16) during 1998 – 2016. Further analysis suggests that the close association
    between TCSO and SST is robust only for major El Niño events, with consistently
    extreme late TCSO following major El Niños during the satellite era. Accompanying
    the decay of major El Niños, tropical equatorial easterly anomalies in the WNP
    are driven by a Matsuno–Gill-type response to the specific SST anomaly pattern
    over the tropical Indo–Pacific sector. This in turn induces an anomalous anticyclone,
    anomalous westerly vertical wind shear, reduced mid-level moisture and suppressed
    convection over the WNP basin—all of which are unfavorable for WNP TCs, resulting
    in delayed TCSO following major El Niño events. These inter-decadal changes in
    the inter-annual correlation between TCSO and ENSO are largely due to the changing
    influence of moderate El Niño events on TCSO before and after the late 1990s.
    This study improves understanding of the ENSO–TC relationship, which should aid
    seasonal outlooks of WNP TC activity.

    Fig. 3. (a) Inter-annual correlation between the standardized onset date of the
    WNP TC season and the December-February (DJF) Niño-3.4 index. Correlations during
    1965 – 2016, 1965 – 1998 and 1999 – 2016, respectively, are 0.37 (significant
    at the 95 % confidence level), 0.46 (significant at the 95 % confidence level)
    and 0.16 (not significant at the 95 % confidence level). (b) Evolution of SST
    anomalies over the Niño-3.4 region and tropical Indian Ocean composited on four
    strong El Niño events (i.e., 1972/1973, 1982/1983, 1997/1998, and 2015/2016).
