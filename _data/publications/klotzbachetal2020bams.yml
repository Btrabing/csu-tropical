  keypoint1: Pressure is more skillful than maximum sustained wind at predicting normalized
    hurricane damage for the continental US from 1900-2018
  keypoint2: Pressure is more akin to an integrated metric than is maximum sustained
    wind and consequently is a more accurate metric of overall storm intensity
  keypoint3: Pressure is also much easier to measure than maximum sustained wind,
    both with aircraft as well as with surface observations
  abstract: Atlantic hurricane seasons have a long history of causing significant
    financial impacts, with Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael combining to
    incur more than 345 billion USD in direct economic damage during 2017-2018.  While
    Michael’s damage was primarily wind and storm surge-driven, Florence’s and Harvey’s
    damage was predominantly rainfall and inland flood-driven.  Several revised scales
    have been proposed to replace the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS),
    which currently only categorizes the hurricane wind threat, while not explicitly
    handling the totality of storm impacts including storm surge and rainfall. However,
    most of these newly-proposed scales are not easily calculated in real-time, nor
    can they be reliably calculated historically. In particular, they depend on storm
    wind radii, which remain very uncertain. Herein, we analyze the relationship between
    normalized historical damage caused by continental United States (CONUS) landfalling
    hurricanes from 1900-2018 with both maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and minimum
    sea level pressure (MSLP).  We show that MSLP is a more skillful predictor of
    normalized damage than Vmax, with a significantly higher rank correlation between
    normalized damage and MSLP (rrank = 0.77) than between normalized damage and Vmax
    (rrank = 0.66) for all CONUS landfalling hurricanes.  MSLP has served as a much
    better predictor of hurricane damage in recent years than Vmax, with large hurricanes
    such as Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) causing much more damage than anticipated
    from their SSHWS ranking. MSLP is also a more accurately-measured quantity than
    is Vmax, making it an ideal quantity for evaluating a hurricane’s potential damage.

  keypoint1: Observations from PREDICT/GRIP/IFEX field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010).
  keypoint2: The onset of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely
    related to the coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels.
  keypoint3: The convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and midlevel
    circulations leading to genesis episodically.
  # Abstract of the paper.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.
