  abstract: This paper summarizes the forecast methods, outputs and skill offered
    by twelve agencies for seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity around the world.
    These agencies use a variety of techniques ranging from statistical models to
    dynamical models to predict basinwide activity and regional activity. In addition,
    several dynamical and hybrid statistical/dynamical models now predict TC track
    density as well as landfall likelihood. Realtime Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecasts
    have shown low skill in April, modest skill in June and good skill in August at
    predicting basinwide TC activity when evaluated over 2003-2018. Real-time western
    North Pacific seasonal TC forecasts have shown good skill by July for basinwide
    intense typhoon numbers and the ACE index when evaluated for 2003-2018. Both hindcasts
    and real-time forecasts have shown skill for other TC basins. A summary of recent
    research into forecasting TC activity beyond seasonal (e.g., multi-year) timescales
    is included. Recommendations for future areas of research are also discussed.

  caption: FIG. 1. Real-time skill of North Atlantic seasonal tropical cyclone outlooks
    assessed for the 16-year period 2003-2018. The skill of the seasonal outlooks
    issued by CSU (red lines), Tropical Storm Risk (TSR, blue lines) and the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, green lines) are compared for (a)
    ACE, (b) major hurricane numbers, (c) hurricane numbers and (d) named storm numbers.
    The skill is shown as the Pearson correlation (r) between the forecast values
    (issued separately in early April, early June and early August) and the observed
    values.
