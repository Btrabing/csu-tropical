  keypoint1: This in box article for BAMS briefly examines seasonal forecasts of Atlantic
    hurricane activity and Arctic sea ice. Both seasonal hurricane forecasts and Arctic
    sea ice predictions need to continue to develop to be more useful for stakeholders
    for risk transfer and mitigation purposes.

  caption: FIG. 1. Forecasts of North Atlantic basinwide hurricane number and verification
    data. The observed number of hurricanes for each season is shown in gray (Landsea
    and Franklin 2013). The light blue dots are all of the latest indi-vidual hurricane
    outlooks collected since 2015 (one dot per group). The dark blue line is the median
    of those outlooks. The green and purple lines are two benchmark forecasts - the
    climatology forecast is defined as the average of all hurricane counts from 1969
    to the current year minus one (green), and the 10-yr persistence forecast is defined
    as the average of all hurricane counts from the 10 preceding years (purple). The
    numbers along the x axis indicate the number of forecast that have been submitted
    for a given year for that particular variable.
  acknowledgement: We would like to acknowledge the participation of the numerous
    forecasting organizations that submit their forecasts to both platforms on a regular
    basis, without whose support neither projects would be possible. LPC and PJK would
    like to acknowledge the support of XL Catlin (now AXA XL). FM is a F.R.S.–FNRS
    Research Associate. PJK would also like to acknowledge support from the G. Unger
    Vetlesen Foundation. JS acknowledges the support of NE/R017123/1 [NSFGEO-NERC
    Advancing Predictability of Sea Ice, Phase 2 of the Sea Ice Prediction Network
    (SIPN2)]. Finally, we are grateful to three anonymous reviewers who provided us
    with helpful comments.
