  keypoint1: This manuscript examines the relationship between the QBO and the MJO
    during the boreal winter and finds that the strong relationship observed in recent
    years did not exist prior to the mid 1970s.  We hypothesize that climate change
    has strengthened the relationship between the MJO and QBO.

  abstract: A strong relationship between the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of
    equatorial stratospheric winds and the amplitude of the Madden-Julian oscillation
    (MJO) during the boreal winter has recently been uncovered using observational
    data from the mid-1970s to the present. When the QBO is in its easterly phase
    in the lower stratosphere, it favors stronger MJO activity during boreal winter,
    while the MJO tends to be weaker during the westerly phase of the QBO. Here we
    show using reconstructed indices of the MJO and QBO back to 1905 that the relationship
    between enhanced boreal winter MJO activity and the easterly phase of the QBO
    has only emerged since the early 1980s. The emergence of this relationship coincides
    with the recent cooling trend in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the warming
    trend in the equatorial upper troposphere, which appears to have sensitized MJO
    convective activity to QBO-induced changes in static stability near the tropopause.
    Climate change is thus suggested to have played a role in promoting coupling between
    the MJO and the QBO.

  caption: FIG. 2. 30-year running correlation between DJF-averaged MJO amplitude
    and the QBO index. Correlation values are shown using the Wheeler-Hendon MJO index
    (red line), the JRA-55 MJO index (blue line) and the long-term reconstructed MJO
    (OT) index (thick black solid line) with the ordinate on the x-axis given by the
    central year of the 30-year running window. Maximum and minimum 30-year running
    correlations for the reconstructed index are also displayed (thin black solid
    lines), calculated from the 56 members of the long-term MJO index ensemble. The
    dashed line represents the 5% statistical significance level.
