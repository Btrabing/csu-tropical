  keypoint1: The eastern North Pacific set records for hurricane activity in 2018
    with relatively little influence from El Niño-Southern Oscillation
  keypoint2: Combined above (below)-average sea surface temperatures and moisture
    (shear) during August and September contributed to the record season
  keypoint3: The strongly positive Pacific Meridional Mode also supported the increase
    in eastern North Pacific hurricane activity
  abstract: The extremely active 2018 eastern North Pacific (ENP) hurricane season
    set records for number of hurricane days, major hurricane days, and accumulated
    cyclone energy (ACE). The Western Development Region (116°W–180°) was especially
    active, shattering its prior record for ACE set in 2015. In addition, Hawaii was
    impacted by Hurricane Lane in August and Tropical Storm Olivia in September. Despite
    above-normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and below-normal vertical wind shear
    in 2018, large-scale conditions were generally less conducive for tropical cyclone
    (TC) formation than in 2015. However, the strong subtropical ridge in August and
    September of 2018 enhanced westward steering flow, thereby keeping TCs over hurricane-favorable
    conditions and preventing recurvature toward lower SSTs and higher vertical wind
    shear. The 2018 ENP hurricane season highlights that El Niño conditions are not
    necessary for extremely high ENP TC activity.
  summary: The 2018 eastern North Pacific hurricane season broke records, particularly
    when considering an index that accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration
    of hurricanes. The previous record was set in 2015 during a strong El Niño event
    that increased ocean warmth and thus provided more fuel for hurricanes. Even though
    a weak El Niño did not develop until late in the 2018 hurricane season, the ocean
    was warmer than normal in the region where the hurricanes formed, which helped
    support their development. After the hurricanes formed, the flow of the atmosphere
    generally kept them over warmer water, helping them last longer. We need to study
    more seasons like 2018 to better understand when eastern North Pacific hurricane
    seasons will be active without the presence of a strong El Niño.
