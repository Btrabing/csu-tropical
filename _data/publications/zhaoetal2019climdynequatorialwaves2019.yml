  keypoint1: This manuscript investigated the roles of several different atmospheric
    wave types on western North Pacific TC formation
  keypoint2: Nearly 80% of western North Pacific TCs were a result of two or more
    different wave types
  keypoint3: When the convectively-enhanced phases of the MJO and equatorial Rossby
    waves were present, synoptic-scale waves tended to be stronger and more organized,
    enhancing TC formation likelihood
  abstract: The tropical cyclone (TC)-centric approach developed in previous studies
    tends to overemphasize the direct impact of tropical waves and underestimates
    their large-scale modulation of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclogenesis
    (TCG). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach based
    on empirical orthogonal function analyses to re-examine associations of multiple
    waves, including the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), quasi-biweekly oscillation
    (QBWO), convective equatorial Rossby (ER) waves, and synoptic scale waves (SSWs),
    with WNP TCG events. There is a close association between WNP TCG events (total
    of 273 TCs in this study) and SSWs (~ 64%), MJO (~ 68%), QBWO (~ 64%) and ER (~ 65%)
    waves. These suggest that SSW is critical for many TCG events, and all of these
    intra-seasonal waves significantly modulate TCG events. A majority of TCs (~ 79%)
    were found to be related to more than one wave type, indicating an important role
    for a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions associated with multiple
    waves in TCG events. Further analyses show that SSW activity is strongly modulated
    by the MJO and ER waves, while the QBWO has no significant impact on SSWs. During
    convectively active MJO and ER phases, stronger SSW trains with more distinct
    southeast-northwestward aligned structures can be found compared to convectively
    inactive phases. Similar intra-seasonal modulation of the transition from the
    mixed Rossby-gravity waves from the equatorial central Pacific to the SSW trains
    over the WNP by the three waves is noted, with such transitions largely favored
    during convectively active MJO and ER phases.
