  abstract: This study examines the association between the western North Pacific
    (WNP) summer monsoon (WNPSM) and WNP tropical cyclone (TC) frequency during June–August
    from 1979 to 2016. The interannual relationship between the WNPSM and the total
    number of WNP TCs has strengthened since 1998. There has also been a significant
    reduction in the number of TCs forming within the WNP monsoon trough (WNPMT)—hereafter
    called ITCs, for internal or inside TCs—since 1998. These two important features
    are found to be closely associated with the climate regime shift that occurred
    around 1998. During 1998–2016, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) tended to
    be in a cold phase, with an increasing occurrence of central Pacific–type El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) events, whereas the 1979–97 period tended to be characterized
    by a warm phase of the PDO and east Pacific–type ENSO events. During 1998–2016,
    the tropical Pacific was characterized by enhanced easterlies, which led to a
    westward-retreated WNPMT that caused a significant decrease in ITCs over the WNP
    basin. However, there was little change in TCs outside of the WNPMT region (hereafter
    called OTCs) compared to that before 1998. A significant in-phase (out-of-phase)
    relationship between the WNPSM and the number of ITCs (OTCs) is observed before
    1998, thus greatly weakening the WNPSM–TC relationship. The recent enhanced relationship
    between the WNPSM and TCs is mainly due to a strong in-phase relationship between
    the WNPSM and ITCs. The interannual change in ITCZ is mainly controlled by WNPSM
    changes since 1998, while OTC changes are mainly modulated by changes in the tropical
    upper-tropospheric trough.

    Fig. 2. (a) Time series of the boreal summer average WNPMI (gray bars) and total
    TC count (red solid line) during 1979–2016. The average WNPMI during 1979–97 and
    1998–2016 is indicated by the black dashed line, and the average total TC count
    for these two subperiods is indicated by the red dashed line. The average for
    the two subperiods and the correlation coefficient between the total TC count
    and WNPMI during the two subperiods are also listed. (b) Time series of the standardized
    summer average WNPMI (black line), Niño-3.4 index (green line), EMI (blue line),
    and total TC count (red line). The correlation coefficients among the WNPMI, EMI,
    and Niño-3.4 index during the two subperiods are also listed. Double asterisks
    indicate statistical significance at a 95% confidence level.
