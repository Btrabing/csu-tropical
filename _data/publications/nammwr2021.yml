  keypoint1: This study examines the interactions of a pre-depression Hagupit with vertical wind shear (VWS) at various spatial scales from synoptic to meso-scales using field observations.
  keypoint2: We highlight the persistent convection maintaining moisture and vorticity inside the wave pouch even under 20 m/s deep-layer VWS.
  keypoint3: Our interpretation of the radar and dropsonde analyses provides a new insight for the supporting role of low-level VWS providing horizontal vorticity and organizing convection in the early stage of tropical cyclogenesis.

    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1) had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various spatial scales.

  caption: "FIG. 14. Schematic of the multi-scale interactions in Hagupitâ€™s cyclogenesis. a) Synoptic scale active features are the upper-level trough and easterly wave which carries the marsupial wave pouch, denoted as red circulation. b) In the meso-alpha scale wave pouch, the low-level cyclonic streamlines are shown with circulation center marked with black cross and mid-level center as yellow cross. Overlain on the clouds to the southwest of the low-level center is vorticity (positive: red, negative: blue), illustrating vorticity dipoles from tilting, enhanced vorticity from stretching, and a mid-level MCV over the stratiform area. c) In the meso-beta scale, the local wind shear profile that influences the convective organization is composed of winds from cyclonic circulation inside pouch, easterly wave propagation, and the trough. d) Meso-gamma scale convective cells produce vorticity that serve as building blocks for the wave pouch intensification through tilting of horizontal vorticity associated with low- level wind shear (S cell) and stretching of the local vertical vorticity (N cell)."
