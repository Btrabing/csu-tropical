  abstract: This study revisits the nonlinear relationship between tropical cyclone
    (TC) size and intensity over the western North Pacific (WNP). Using best track
    data from the Japan Meteorological Agency from 2007‐2019, we find that the statistical
    turning point on a fitted size‐intensity curve only exists for TCs with greater
    lifetime peak intensities (e.g. typhoons). The track and evolution type are two
    factors determining the statistical size‐intensity relationship. The nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship is only observed for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes at different times, due to a non‐monotonic size change
    during the weakening stage. The slight size decrease in the initial weakening
    stage can be linked to a TC weakening‐induced shrinkage balanced by a baroclinic
    expansion when recurving typhoons move into higher latitudes. Finally, different
    evolution types for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size
    to its theoretical maximum.
  summary: Tropical cyclone (TC) size and intensity are two primary metrics determining
    the destructive potential of a TC. Previous studies have reported a nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship, in which TC size substantially increases with intensity
    to an upper bound and then remains constant or even decreases with increasing
    intensity. Using best tracks from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) for 2007‐2019,
    we find that this statistical nonlinear size‐intensity relationship only occurs
    for TCs with stronger lifetime maximum intensities (e.g. typhoons). Whether the
    size‐intensity relationship is linear or nonlinear is jointly determined by the
    track that the TC takes and its evolution type on a size‐intensity diagram. There
    is a linear size‐intensity relationship for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes simultaneously and for typhoons that are relatively
    straight‐moving. For other recurving typhoons, the nonlinear size‐intensity relationship
    is primarily caused by a nonlinear size decrease during the weakening stage. We
    speculate that, as recurving typhoons move poleward, weakening TCs often begin
    to shrink, while the interaction between the TC and the midlatitude circulation
    leads to a baroclinic expansion of TC size. Finally, different evolution types
    for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size to its theoretical
    maximum.
