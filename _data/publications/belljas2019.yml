  keypoint1: Observations from PREDICT/GRIP/IFEX field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010).
  keypoint2: The onset of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely
    related to the coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels.
  keypoint3: The convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and midlevel
    circulations leading to genesis episodically.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  caption: FIG. 11. Analyzed time series of meso-a-averaged quantities from initial
    aircraft mission to Karl’s genesis. (a) Circulation tendency [1025 s21 3 (600
    km)2 day21] at 850 (red circles) and 500 hPa (blue squares) using the left abscissa
    and saturation fraction up to 700 hPa (green triangles) and cold-cloud fraction
    below 2608C from Davis and Ahijevych (2012) using the right abscissa. (b) Relative
    humidity at 850 hPa (green triangles, %), virtual potential temperature anomaly
    at 850 hPa (purple squares, K), and virtual potential temperature anomaly at 500hPa
    (black diamonds, K). The anomaly was calculated by removing the mean uy from the
    time series at each respective level. Red stars below (b) denote mission times,
    with 0000 and 1200 UTC 13 Sep highlighted.
