  keypoint1: Rain drop size distributions in Harvey and Florence were broadly similar
    to other tropical cyclones
  keypoint2: High-concentrations of midsize drops were more common and widespread
    in Harvey than in Florence
  keypoint3: Harvey's rainfall was more intense and asymmetric due to vertical wind
    shear and a weaker intensity
  abstract: Polarimetric coastal radar data are used to compare the rainfall characteristics
    of Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018). Intense rainfall was an infrequent
    yet important contributor to the total rainfall in Harvey, but its relative contribution
    varied spatially. The total rainfall over land maximized near the coast over Beaumont,
    TX due to intense convection resulting from prolonged onshore flow downshear from
    the circulation center. Overall, polarimetric radar observations in Harvey show
    a dominance of high concentrations of small-to-medium drops, consistent with prior
    tropical cyclone studies. The microphysical characteristics were spatially and
    temporally inhomogeneous however, with larger drops more frequent on 27 August
    and higher number concentrations more frequent on 28 and 30 August. The polarimetric
    variables and raindrop characteristics observed during Florence share broad similarities
    to Harvey, but had reduced variability, fewer observations of stronger reflectivity
    and differential reflectivity, and a lower frequency of high number concentrations
    and medium-sized drops. The radar data indicate Florence had reduced coverage
    of stronger convection compared to Harvey. We hypothesize that differences in
    storm motion, intensity decay rates, and vertical wind shear produce the distinct
    precipitation structures and microphysical differences seen in Harvey and Florence.

    FIG. 9. a) Joint probability distribution (contours) of range-weighted $N_W$ and
    $D_0$ values calculated from the KHGX polarimetric data for Harvey between 0000
    UTC on 26 August and 0000 UTC on 31 August. Theoretical LWC values (colors) are
    calculated from Equation 2. Labels indicate the different DSD quadrants (SL: low-concentration
    small drops, ML: low-concentration medium drops, SH: high-concentration small
    drops, and MH: high-concentration medium drops). b) As in a), but for data from
    KMHX for Florence between 0000 UTC on 13 September and 1922 UTC on 15 September,
    when the radar went offline and c) the difference joint probability distribution
    between Florence/KMHX and Harvey/KHGX (dashed contours indicate frequencies were
    greater for KHGX).
