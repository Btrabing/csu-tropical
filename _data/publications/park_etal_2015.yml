  abstract: 'On average, three tropical cyclones (TCs) affect the Republic of Korea each year, causing extensive
  damage. To alleviate the TC-induced disasters, the Korean government has invested nearly 4% of its
  annual budget in recent decades in prevention efforts; however, the effectiveness of this costly
  program has not been evaluated. This study determined whether any evidence shows a reduced
  vulnerability to TCs in Korea over 1979–2010 by utilizing multi-linear regression. Homelessness,
  casualties, and property losses were individually examined. These explained variables were normalized
  into the socio-economic circumstances of 2005 before the regression to eliminate the effect of
  changing exposure by dealing with population and wealth at provincial levels. Three potential
  explanatory variables based on nationwide weather-station data were considered, including the
  maximum wind, maximum rainfall, and number of affected stations over each TC’s damaging period.
  In addition, the annual per capita income, showing a quasi-linear increasing tendency, was used as an
  additional explanatory variable to examine how vulnerability is altered. The results revealed that each
  empirical model of homelessness, casualties, and property losses can account for 47%, 57%, and 57%
  of each variance, respectively, which is highest when considering all four explanatory variables.
  Consistently negative coefficients of the per capita income terms for all damage types suggest that the
  vulnerability to TCs has been significantly reduced. This finding appears to be partly the result of the
  national prevention effort, although it also can be attributed to other unintended adaptation factors,
  such as building codes, industrial structures, and land use.'
