  Chandra Pasillas is a Ph. D. candidate co-advised by Michael Bell and
  Christian Kummerow. She is working to advance geostationary nighttime
  multi-spectral imaging for low cloud detection with applications towards
   improving fog forecasting and tropical cyclone forecasting through the
   use of derived motion winds.Chandra received her Bachelors’ of Science
   in Meteorology from the United States Air Force Academy in 2004, and then
    entered the United States Air Force (USAF) as a weather officer. She
    obtained her Masters’ of Science in Atmosphere Science from the Naval
    Post-graduate School where she studied the impacts of time latency and
    satellite selection to the USAF’s World Wide Merged Cloud Analysis (WWMCA)
     product under Dr. Tom Murphree. In addition to her current research,
     Chandra is interested in bringing research products into operations
     capacity to provide today’s forecasters with the best tools available
     for informing leaders and aviators of adverse weather impacts.
