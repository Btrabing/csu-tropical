bio: >
  Jhordanne is a PhD candidate studying the relationships between the
  large-scale
   tropical environment and tropical cyclone activity with a focus on improving
   subseasonal to seasonal forecast prediction. Another part of her research
   includes studying ways in which the combination of global climate model
   output
    and machine learning can be used to improve prediction skill. Jhordanne
    received her MPhil./MSc. in Applied Physics (Climate Physics) in 2016 from
    the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. For her Masterâ€™s
    thesis, she studied changes in North Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency by
    operational statistical forecast schemes in a warmed climate. In future
    work,
     Jhordanne hopes to further explore hurricane activity in climate model
     environments and examine how much predictability (and future projection)
     can be gained from them.
