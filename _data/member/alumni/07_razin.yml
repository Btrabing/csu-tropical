  Naufal is a PhD candidate who hails from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
  He got his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from the University of Hawai‘i
   at Mānoa, followed by his Master’s of Atmospheric Science from Colorado
   State University. For both his Master’s and PhD research, Naufal has been
   studying the dynamics of stratiform and convective precipitation in
   tropical cyclone (TC) rainbands and their effects on intensity, primarily
   using remote sensing tools such as radar and satellite observations. He is
   also one of the main authors for the Tropical Cyclone Precipitation,
   Infrared, Microwave, and Environmental Dataset (TC PRIMED) – a dataset of
   TC-centered passive microwave observations, supplemented by other data such
   as infrared and TC environmental diagnostics. Naufal is a huge fan of
   Liverpool FC and enjoys playing the guitar as well as indulging in nature
   photography/time-lapse in his free time. He also enjoys hiking, camping,
   and playing pick-up soccer – if his knees would allow.
