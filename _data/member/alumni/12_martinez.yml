  Jon Martinez is a PhD candidate. Jon was born and raised in Hollywood,
   Florida where he experienced several landfalling hurricanes that inspired
    his interest in tropical cyclone research. Jon’s primary research focuses
     on understanding the mesoscale structure and evolution of tropical
     cyclones with high-resolution observational data and numerical
     simulations. Jon’s research interests also include severe wind
     production in mesoscale convective systems; tropical cyclone frequency and
      risk assessment amidst Earth's warming climate system; tropical
      cyclogenesis and climate variability; and the economics of climate
       change. Jon was recently awarded the National Center for Atmospheric
       Research (NCAR) Advanced Study Program (ASP) Postdoctoral Fellowship.
       As an ASP Postdoctoral Fellow, Jon will investigate how tropical cyclone
        frequency might change amidst Earth's warming climate system by
        analyzing variability in the processes that contribute to tropical
        cyclone formation.
