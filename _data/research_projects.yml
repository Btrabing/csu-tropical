  title: Dynamics, Thermodynamics, and Microphysics of Extreme Rainfall observed during PRECIP
  grant: NSF Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP)
  full_name: NSF Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP)
  description: Extreme rainfall is a high impact weather phenomenon that profoundly affects people around the world, but our fundamental understanding and quantitative forecast skill for these events remains limited. To address these important scientific and forecast challenges, PRECIP in summer 2021 over Taiwan will be conducted to improve our understanding of the multi-scale dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical processes that produce extreme precipitation. <br> <br>

  title: Heating, Cooling, and Rapid Intensity Change in Tropical Cyclones
  grant: ONR Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification (TCRI)
  full_name: ONR Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification (TCRI)
  description: The central objectives of this research are to improve our understanding of diabatic heating and cooling during TC rapid intensification (RI). The proposed research will accomplish these objectives through an analysis of field observations in conjunction with high-resolution numerical modeling. The central hypothesis of this research is that RI is caused by high efficiency diabatic heating and associated potential vorticity generation that requires cooperation across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

  title: Improvement of sub-seasonal to seasonal Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts
  grant: Tropical Cyclone Forecasting
  full_name: Tropical Cyclone Forecasting
  description: CSU has been issuing seasonal Atlantic hurricane forecasts since 1984. These forecasts have evolved  since their inception and now include sub-seasonal (e.g., two-week) forecasts issued during the peak months of the hurricane season. While these forecasts have shown skill when issued in real time, there remains significant room for improvement. Current research involves a better understanding of the drivers of sub-seasonal to seasonal variability driving hurricane activity, with a focus on vertical wind shear.

  title: NSF CSU Sea-Going Polarimetric (SEA-POL) Radar
  grant: NSF CSU SEA-POL radar
  full_name: NSF CSU SEA-POL radar
  description: SEA-POL is a NSF Community Facility available for community requests for deployment in the U.S. and around the globe. Numerous science opportunities are possible with a portable, 5-cm wavelength radar in atmospheric science including advances in tropical and mid-latitude weather, regional climate and climate change, cloud microphysics, dynamics of convective storms, and extreme weather impacts. SEA-POL can also contribute to interdisciplinary science in oceanography, hydrology, and water resources.
