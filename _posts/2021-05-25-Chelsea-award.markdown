Ph.D. candidate Chelsea Nam received the Best Student Oral Presentation Award from the 14th International Conference on Mesoscale Convective Systems and High-Impact Weather in East Asia (ICMCS-XIV). Nam’s presentation, “Bifurcation Points for Tropical Cyclone Genesis in Sheared and Dry Environments,” was co-authored by her adviser, Professor Michael Bell, and Dandan Tao, a former research scientist in the Bell group.

Nam presented her research virtually to the hybrid format conference in Nanjing, China. The 10-hour time difference meant the conference started at 6:30 p.m. local time.

Nam was excited to share her results and receive feedback from colleagues.

“I realized I have been missing opportunities to interact with fellow scientists and just how important these conferences are to motivate and encourage graduate students like me,” Nam said.

“I am so grateful for this award, especially because the research that went into the presentation was not the easiest task for me. … It was my first time dealing with very large WRF ensemble data sets – a definite learning-curve experience.”
